# PersonalWebsite
This is my personal website that I am building for WebCo! The endgoal of this project is to learn a lot about html and CSS
and make something pretty and functional. I would also love to be able to post my AI agents for Atari games eventually
once I learn how to use jscript and input python.

Work in progess!
